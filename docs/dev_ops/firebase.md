## Components 

1. [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth)

    Firebase Authentication provides <emp>backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app.</emp> It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more. Firebase Authentication integrates tightly with other Firebase services, and it leverages industry standards like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, so it can be easily integrated with your custom backend. </p>

2. [Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions)

    Cloud Functions for Firebase is a serverless framework that lets you automatically run backend code in response to events triggered by Firebase features and HTTPS requests. Your JavaScript or TypeScript code is stored in Google's cloud and runs in a managed environment.

    !!! Warning 

        Javascript and typescript only 

- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore):

    Firebase's newest database for mobile app development. It builds on the successes of the Realtime Database with a new, more intuitive data model. Cloud Firestore also features richer, faster queries and scales further than the Realtime Database.

    !!! Warning 
        
        Not persistant by default. <br />
        
        1M conncurrent connections 10k r/w per sec <br />  </p>

- [Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database):

    Firebase's original database. It's an efficient, low-latency solution for mobile apps that require synced states across clients in realtime.

    !!! Warning 
        
        ‚ùó hard limit 200k connections and 1k writes/sec. <br /> </p>

- [Cloud Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage)

    Standard Blob Storage, store images, audio, video, or other user-generated content. On the server, you can use Google Cloud Storage APIs to access the same files. </p>

- [Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting)

     
    - Using the [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli), you deploy files from local directories on your computer to our Hosting servers. <br />
    
    - Beyond serving static content, you can use [Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions) for Firebase or [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/) to serve dynamic content and host microservices onyour sites. <br />
    
    - All content is served over an SSL connection from the closest edge server on our global CDN. You can also view and test your changes before going live. <br />
    Using the Firebase Local Emulator Suite, you can emulate your app and backend resources at a locally hosted URL. <br />
    
    - You can also share your changes at a temporary preview URL and set up a GitHub integration for easy iterations during development. <br /> </p>


- [ML Kit](https://firebase.google.com/products/ml)

    - Firebase Machine Learning is a mobile SDK that brings Google's machine learning expertise to Android and iOS apps. <br />

        **Pre-trained models:** <br />
            - Text recognition <br />
            - Image labelin g<br />
            - Object detection and tracking <br />
            - Face detection and contour tracing <br />
            - Barcode scanning <br />
            - Language identification <br />
            - Translation <br />
            - Smart Reply <br />

## **Services**

- [Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics)

    Firebase Crashlytics is a lightweight, realtime crash reporter that helps you track, prioritize, and fix stability issues that erode your app quality. <br />
    Crashlytics saves you troubleshooting time by intelligently grouping crashes and highlighting the circumstances that lead up to them. <br />
    Find out if a particular crash is impacting a lot of users. Get alerts when an issue suddenly increases in severity.<br />
    Figure out which lines of code are causing crashes. <br /> </p>

- [Performance Monitoring](https://firebase.google.com/docs/perf-mon)

    Performance Monitoring SDK to collect performance data from your app, then review and analyze that data in the Firebase console. <br />
    Performance Monitoring helps you to understand in real time where the performance of your app can be improved so that you can use that information to fix performance issues.


- [Robo](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/android/robo-ux-test)

    Robo test is a testing tool that is integrated with Firebase Test Lab.  <br />
    Robo test analyzes the structure of your app's UI and then explores it methodically, automatically simulating user activities. <br /> 

- [Test Lab](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab)

    Firebase Test Lab is a cloud-based app testing infrastructure that lets you test your app on a range of devices and configurations, so you can get a better idea of how it'll perform in the hands of live users. <br />

- [App Distribution](https://firebase.google.com/products-release)

    Firebase App Distribution makes distributing your apps to trusted testers painless. <br />
    By getting your apps onto testers' devices quickly, you can get feedback early and often. <br />
    And if you use Crashlytics in your apps, you‚Äôll automatically get stability metrics for all your builds, so you know when you‚Äôre ready to ship. <br />

- [Performance Monitoring](https://firebase.google.com/products/performance)

    use the Performance Monitoring SDK to collect performance data from your app, then review and analyze that data in the Firebase console. <br />
