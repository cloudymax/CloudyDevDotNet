# ðŸ§¨ firecracker microVMs ðŸ’»

[Firecracker](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/)microVM's using [KVM](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization/what-is-KVM) are an interesting contender in this space as they provide the full machine via KVM directly to metal but can be overprovisioned.

Firecraker was developed by Amazon for use w/ AWS EC2 Fargate and Lambda to sol the following problems:

- High overhead for dedicated VM's per-tenant
- Under-Uitilization of metal assets
- Multi-tenant cluster security
- Ephemerality for Serverless systems

__Pros__:

- __Fast__. __as__. __hell__. Instantiates in ~__125ms__, throughput of __150VMs__ per second, __*per host*__.
- Multi-tenant __secure__ by running in a VM using KVM instad of a container.
- __Over provisionable__ so thousands fit on a single node
- __Compatible w/ containrd__ to be managed like a container [firecracker-containerd](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker-containerd)

__Cons__:

- No GPU support/ passthrough. __ever__. That requires pinning memory addresses, which negates the ability to over-provision

__Thoughs__:

- If you're processing lots of databse queries, small data transformations or messaging - firecraker is an incrible way to achieve
high-density workload saturation. It's fast, efficient, and it's a tailor-made solution for serverless systems.

- If youre workloads need GPU acceleration, lifecycle management, high uptime, or consume lots of resources over a longer duration, I dont think firecracker is your best option here.
