### __FedEx Express__

> Senior Architect
>
> 2020 - Present

* As Sr. Architect I led efforts to shift FedEx's European co-location and public cloud assets to on-prem and hybrid-cloud following the acquisition of TNT Netherlands. Coordinating with international teams, I developed a golden-path architecture using Ansible, Terraform, Azure Cloud, and VMware Tanzu, which aligned with international business OKRs and key strategic initiatives, specifically: Cost Optimization, Cost Observability, Speed of Service, Security, and Carbon-Neutrality.

    ??? Example "Projects & Accomplishments"

          1. <b>Ephemeral On-Prem Hybrid-Cloud Platform</b>

            Ansible, Terraform, Azure Arc, VMware Tanzu CE, Cluster API, Azure Kubernetes Service 

            > Building from two directions - Bare-Metal Up and Pubic-CLoud Down - Created a unified container orchestration layer through homogenization of varied hardware and network types using ephemeral identities, infrastructure.

          - <b>Internal Memory-Cache/ORM interface:</b>

            Python, Hazelcast, Postgres, Snap, Ubuntu Core

            > Broke through a deadlock caused by legacy licensing processes providing a step-change solution in the interim to enable further cloud transformation.

          - <b>Multiple static website generator micro-services</b>

            Mkdocs, Jekyll Material, Python, Webpack and the accompanying build/deploy pipelines using Azure, Github, Jenkins, Ansible, Terraform
            >
            > Allows multiple teams to automatically generate documentation that is compliant with internal CSS, UX, Branding, and Accessibility standards.

          - <b>Multiple DBaaS micro-services</b> 
    
            MongoDB, Postgres 11, Hazelcast IMDG

            > Provided an approved selection of containerized database/cache products pre-configured and certified for use with internal self-service platform. 

          - <b>Microservice to dynamically generate Terraform files/HCL objects</b> 

            Backend, TFvars, Providers, Versions etc...

            > Generated HCL output from json, yaml, or database values allowing the creation/replication of the full azure production AZure Kubernestes as an ephemeral platform. This also enabled the use of terraform to use ephemeral identities in internal pipelines.

          - <b>Multiple Terraform modules<b> 

            Keyvaults, Secrets, Certificates, Keys, Blob Storage Accounts and Containers, IAM, RBAC, AD Groups, Users, Applications, Identities, AKS clusters, Virtual Machines, and Scale Sets

            > for use with company IaaC, PaaS, SaaS, and IAM/RBAC products. These modules added or enhanced features of the FedEx Azure cloud platform.

          - <b>Akv2k8s</b>: 

            Terraform, Azure Keyvault, Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Managed Identities, Service Principles, Secrets, Keys, and Certificates.

            > end-to-end automated test and install to synchronize assets between Azure and Kubernetes using mutating webhooks and init containers. Utilized the Kubernetes Alpha provider to install CRDs required to automate testing

          - <b>Azure Pod Identity</b>: 

            Azure Active Directory, Managed Identities, Azure Kubernetes Service, Terraform

            > end-to-end test and install of aad-pod-identity, a project allowing Kubernetes clusters to access cloud resources, and teams access k8s using Azure Active Directory. Also utilized the Kubernetes Alpha provider for installing custom CRDs to automate testing
