# Unity Projects

I work with Unity3D quite a bit for simulations, data-viz, and hobby games. Here are some open-source tools I've put together over the years that others may find helpful.

## Deployment Tools

- [Unity3D WebGL builds on Nginx with ArgoCD](https://github.com/buildstar-online/unity-webgl-nginx)

- [Realtime GI example for pixel-streaming](https://github.com/buildstar-online/demo-room)

## Build and Dev Environments

- [Unity3D Ephemeral License Creation and Activation](https://github.com/buildstar-online/unity-self-auth)

- [GPU-enabled containers with GameCI](https://github.com/buildstar-online/gameci-docker-extras)

- [GPU-Accelerated containerized desktops](https://github.com/buildstar-online/nvidia-desktops)

## In-Engine Stuff

- [Spline-based particle animation](game_dev/splines.md)

- [Virtual Office](game_dev/virtual-office.md)

- [Old Code Tests](game_dev/code-tests.md)
