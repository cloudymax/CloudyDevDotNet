# An anonymous interview for the position of "*Linux Gaming Product Manager*" at Canonical. 

Firstly, I would like to gratefully acknowledge the time and effort of those who will be reading through this interview. I've done my best to keep it informative, enjoyable and accessible. 


## Education History

> <strong>*"How did you fare in high school mathematics, physical sciences and computing? Which were your strengths and which most enjoyable? How did you rank, competitively, in these subjects?"*</strong>
<br>

I remember High school mathematics as a very strong lesson in "*putting in the work*" more than anything else. I was not nearly as interested in mathematics as I was music at the time, electing to take more music-theory and performance classes over sciences and maths until nearly the end of my high school education.

I had always performed quite well in physical sciences, arts, and algebra, but more complex maths Trigonometry and Physics caused me to struggle with my lack of proper study and note-taking habits. I'm incredibly grateful for my 3rd year physics teacher and my tutor from the local community college who helped me to better understand applied mathematics and healthy study habits in a enormous way. Thanks to them, I'm able to do cool things like write procedurally-generated bezier-curve animations or real-time volumetric reverb and occlusion tools.  

As I mentioned, I've always performed well on American standardized testing - placing regularly in the 95-99th percentile with Reading, Language Arts and Essays being slightly stronger than Mathematics. I scored well enough on my SAT/ACT (1440/31) to merit partial scholarship awards, but as the years pass and I learn more about the biases and omissions of that education, I believe those scores and tests to be more harmful than helpful.


<br>
    
> *"What sort of high school student were you? Outside of required work, what were your interests and hobbies?  What would your high school peers remember you for, if we asked them?"*
<br>

To be completely honest, I was not a very good student back in those days. I had gotten by on being a quick study and testing well until early high-school, but I hadn't developed healthy study habits yet nor would I until nearly the end of my Junior year. I struggled a lot with an untreated disability as well as with emotional issues due to an inability to access proper medical and mental healthcare. This affected me the most in mathematics where proofs were required to be submitted in writing which I would frequently make small mistakes on due to the above while still solving the problem/formulae properly. As I mentioned previously though, my 3rd year really marked a turning point in my approach to my studies,

Beyond my struggles with more mathematics, I poured my time into several extracurricular activities and clubs. I was in the school Jazz Band/Marching Band, Chess Club, Cooking Club, Intramural Basketball team, Creative Writing Club, Computer Club, and even started for the football team for a season as a defensive end/kicker.
It was the intersectionality of Music, Art and Technology in many of these clubs that would push me to pursue a degree in Music Technology, and eventually programming.

Though I very tech-oriented these days, most people from back then will probably remember me from music projects more than anything else. I was very active in my city's music scene - playing live shows with several bands, doing studio work for others, even playing at the state football championship half-time show and opening for global acts like Bring Me the Horizon and Four Year Strong at one point. It was a ton of fun, but unfortunately just cannot compete with a Systems Engineering salary. 


<br>
> In languages and the arts at high school, what were your strongest subjects and how did you rank in those among your school peers?
</br>
    
My strongest subjects in school by were music and writing - my school didn't rank students against one another in any official capacity. We compared test scores of course but no reliable ranking system existed. By that very loose standard, you could say I was one of the better musicians/writers in my grade and slightly poorer than average in foreign language skill and mathematics.
    
<br>    

> Please outline some high school achievements considered exceptional by peers and staff members.

<br> 

- My Freshman year, I won first prize in a writing contest by 3M and Scholastic for which the prize was a classroom makeover for my english teacher and $500 for me. I promptly spent the money on a set of Paiste hi-hats, 16" crash and a used pair of iron-cobra double kick-pedals.

- I was the first Guitarist to be allowed to join the school jazz, pep, and marching bands and performed at the KY State High School Football Championships as part of the St. Xavier Marching Band. The school music and band director started his career at my school my freshman year and was a huge influence in my education. They delegated a lot of responsibility to myself and a few other students to handle the arrangement, composition, logistics and technical work to allow stringed instruments into marching band for the first time in school history.

- I worked as a landscaper, nurseryman, and forklift/bobcat operator after school to pay my way through school - specifically extracurricular activities, club fees, meal passes. (I was fortunate to have received a tuition discount via a scholarship and need-based funding which allowed me to only work part-time.)    

- Could open any classroom door on campus with only an un-bent student-ID if you got locked out.

- Accidentally co-invented the short-lived local fad-sport of "Gnardoggin" 

- Made friends with a bunch of kids from the computer club by helping them upgrade the RAM in their gaming pc's so they could raid in World of Warcraft. They invited me to join in with them and thats how I ended up doing 25-man raids with OperationCWAL and Vokda on US-Mannoroth for a while. I don't play WoW anymore but a few dear friends form those days still keep in touch and that means the world to me.  

<br>   

> Which degree and university did you choose, and why?
<br>

I chose to go to Bellarmine University eventually due to it being local and allowing me to continue to work while going to school and that based on scholarships and grants I would be able to attend for only the cost of books and materials. I had wanted to attend Tulane University which had offered an equivalent scholarship, however the campus was hit very hard by Hurricane Katrina that year forcing the school to close. 

<br>    

> Which university courses did you perform best at? How did you rank in your degree?
<br>

Music Technology, Music Theory and Composition, and English Literature were my strongest subjects by far. Though i did not complete my full degree. I was recruited out of school at the end of my 2nd year to take a full-time position with Pizza Hut Inc at their Restaurant Excellence Center. 
    
Pizza Hut had moved the support teams for their SUSE-based point-of-sale platform from Kansas to Kentucky and were heavily recruiting technical talent with restaurant and food-service experience. At the time, I was a Music Technology student working nights as a Kitchen Manager trying to support my family, so it was a near-perfect match for the both od us.

<br>    

> Outside of class, what were your interests and where did you spend your time?
<br>

Outside of class and work you could probably find me:

- fixing broken macbooks and windows laptops for other music majors
- trying to get video games to work on my macbook
- trying to get video games to work on anything even a tiny bit better than my macbook
- playing some of the games I got working on my macbook (mainly world of warcraft or emulated playstation/n64 games)
- trying to make my own games with RPG Maker and Unity 3D

At one point I even published a huge writeup and benchmark about the struggles of gaming on my macbook to MMOchampion.com which was a fun weekend project.

<br>    

> What did you achieve at university that you consider exceptional?

- Was the primary instrument composer and guitarist for a local band that saw moderate success in the local touring circuit, most notably getting to play shows at The Brewery Thunderdome with Forever The Sickest Kids + We The Kings and opening for Bring Me The Horizon and Four Year Strong during the 'Taste of Chaos' tour. 

- Composed multiple musical tracks gaining 10,000+ Soundcloud listens over 3 years. (Soundcloud unfortunately took a very aggressive stance on remixing/sampling a few years ago a purged a significant amount of content form the site)

- Won the Wolf-Howl Award "Best Original Sound Design" from Dragon's Eye Productions (makers of the mmorpg "*Furcadia*") for a commissioned piece of atmospheric music set to accompany a reading of "The Raven" as players traversed a dark pixel-art wonderland in search of a missing locket.

## Context

> Describe your experience with desktop Linux

My first introduction to linux desktop (previously I was Mac/Windows only) was onboarding to the Pizza Hut Inc team. They ran a full point-of-sale and restaurant ops software suite on a heavily customized SUSE base and it became my job to support that OS and Software across a massive hardware footprint spanning legacy ASCII ATT5201's and Unix terminal servers, printers, switches, and modems to modern x86 based touch screen units connected to edge-compute nodes running a proprietary java-based POS system.

As their technology stack matured, and non-touchscreen units began to sunset out of the ecosystem, it became clear the there would be a huge cost associated with upgrading an aging fleet of POS hardware. At this time, the company decide to switch from SUSE to Ubuntu 14.04 as the base of the newest version of the platform and I was assigned the task of porting existing X11/xorg configurations from SUSE to Ubuntu and creating new configurations and patches as needed. 

Around this time, Unity3D released their first Linux compatible builds of the editor and engine. I spent some time developing a proof of concept for an automated virtual help-desk agent and gamified network/hardware visualization system using Unity and Ubuntu which was a fun step away from Java in our ecosystem.

From this point I was in charge of the entire hardware acquisition and certification pipeline at Pizza Hut. I worked with partners to ensure the continued supply of compatible Pont of Sale devices by providing integration support to our platform at the OS level and created the GM images with which to provision remote hardware in the field. I've been a pretty enthusiastic proponent of linux and especially Ubuntu and the intersectional opportunities it represents ever since. I made the switch from windows and mac to linux full time a while back and spend my free time creating automation scripts that will hopefully help others do the same. 

> Describe your experience with the Linux gaming tech stack - from drivers to app stores

This is a hard one to answer because there are multiple answers. The convention wisdom of game development diverged form the rest of software development a while back and has been in a bit of a strange place since. Game development is primarily a closed-source affair involving mountains of proprietary code and a firm determination to make one machine scale vertically forever. To that effect, tradition gaming wisdom demands the latest drivers, the latest hardware, the latest OS etc etc. 

Meanwhile, cloud-native and micro-service went a different direction. Instead of thinking aggressively inside the user's box, there was a focus on the unification of boxes into a unified compute platform capable of scaling horizontally to incredible extents. In this endeavor tools like docker and containerization, nested virtualization, infrastructure as code rose to prominence to solve core problems with the software delivery process.

These advancements unfortunately pass without notice for game developers and studios still in deep windows territory. Proliferation of DevSecOps, Cloud-Native, Containerization, Virtualization and other tools we rely on in the enterprise daily simply do not exist below the largest of AAA developes and a few ex-enterprise led endeavors. (trust me, I've been interviewing with a LOT of them to find a good fit).

As a gamer, I can tell you about the distro, display manager, packages, bios options, middleware, drivers you need to execute a program, and it's not bad. There's a ton of projects out there to get you started like SteamOS, Lutris, retroarch  etc...

As a game developer, I can tell you how painful it is to actually try to develop a game on a full open-source stack right now. Honestly if I didn't have the experience form my day job on Linux it probably wouldn't happen.

> Outline your understanding of the game streaming opportunity for both mobile and console or desktop class games

Game streaming is the logical outcome of a chip shortage, crypto boom, rise of cloud computing and other factors that really need to be embraced as a fixture going forward.
As of a few months ago, Xbox Game Pass and Nvidia Geforce Now had a combined membership of over 5 million users with a base paid tier of ~$100/year.
As a game developer I cannot safely assume my user base will have access to affordable silicon with which to run my game so I must either embrace up-scaling, less intense graphics, fewer sales, or game streaming.

While there is the foundational issue of latency - serving a hardware accelerated virtual machines or containers from a remote host to a local client is something we've been doing in the cloud for years, though with the very narrow perspective of attempting to capture users into walled-gardens (play store, Xbox Game Pass, Playstation live, Geforce Now) of proprietary software and hardware versus an open-source operating system.

> What would your top priority items be to get right for gaming on Ubuntu?

The onboarding experience for both gamers and developers needs to be radically revamped. Theres an entire segment of developers who haven't been introduced to even the most basic of elements in the cloud-native stack. As DevOps and PaaS/IaaS engineers we've been setting up, managing and configuring remote systems automatically for years and we need to offer that same enterprise experience to developers setting up their dev environments and pipelines, and to gamers who need to proper system configurations in-place to make their game run correctly.

If we want gaming on ubuntu to improve, game-making on ubuntu and linux in general needs to improve. We must also remember to let the other members of the cloud-native community shine when they have a chance to do so. Ubuntu may be best served in some situations as a Host OS for virtualization instead of the client desktop, and that is just as important as we must advance Linux as a whole.
